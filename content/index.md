## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Enfu, a senior student in the Department of Computer Science at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU). I will be continuing my studies at the Institute of Computer Science and Engineering at NYCU next year.

My research interest is in Robotics. Outside of academics, I enjoy reading novels, developing games with Unity, and weightlifting.
